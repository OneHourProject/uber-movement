# Uber Movement

> Uber movement provides data and tools for cities to more deeply understand and address urban transportation challenges. Cities are the backdrop of our lives - they are complicated, ever-changing places. As Uber has powered the movement of millions from A to B, we've uncovered unique insights about how and why people move. Movement harnesses this insight to help cities achieve their strategic goals: from reducing congestion and emissions, to improving road safety. We're excited to partner with cities to bring Uber Movement to life. Let's build together!
